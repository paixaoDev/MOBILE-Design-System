### Branch:  
All work must be done using a new branch, every branch must be created following a pattern in its name:
**[type]** / **[context]** / **[description]**  

exemple:
```
feat/button/secondary_button*
```

#### types of branch:   
- **[feat]**: Branch that **adds** a new feature to the project
- **[fix]**: Branch that ***solves** some issue, mainly listed on our **issues** page.
- 
#### Description:
Create a description already thinking about the type and context of the branch, if you have the **feat** type, in a **buttons** context, you don't need to describe that you are creating a new button, but just the name of the button that will be created.

exemple:
```
feat/button/secondary_button*
```

> Before creating a branch, it is advisable to search by description if there is not already another branch created with the same theme, this problem tends not to happen if this work is started based on an item on our **issues** page.

### Commit
It is important to follow a commit pattern to make it easier for others to help with the development of the project, as well as to have a well-developed history. For this, it is recommended that the commit description [follow a pattern.](https://www.dio.me/articles/git-boas-praticas-para-escrita-das-mensagens-de-commits)

>Commit messages should be short and to the point, with no more than 72 characters on the first line (subject) and one blank line after the first line (description). This makes it easier for other developers to quickly understand what was done.
>
### Merge Request
In the MR we must describe what was modified, if it came from an issue it must be linked in the description.

> This step is very important, so it may take some time.
