# MOBILE-Design-System
Open Source MOBILE Design System repository writen in Compose

## How contribute?
To contribute you need to create a **merge request(MR)** following the **delivery rules**, which will then be reviewed and merged! Don't know what could help? How about going to the **issue** page and picking one to solve?

> It is important to understand a little about compose development and atomic design, as this design system follows this concept. See the [CONTRIBUTING.mg](https://github.com/paixaoDev/MOBILE-Design-System/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details
   
## What is Atomic Design?
Atomic Design is a methodology developed in 2013 by Brad Frost, which makes an analogy with chemistry by using elements such as atoms, molecules and organisms to create more consistent and standardized design systems within the development of an interface.

## Design Tokens?
Tokens are like variables that are used to build the components of a design system, they can be colors, sizes, among many other values.
The tokens of this design system mainly use the [material design theme builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/), mainly to maintain the use of dynamic colors and to facilitate the creation of a theme sheet with the material design builder.

An example of our token sheet can be found [here](https://github.com/paixaoDev/MOBILE-Design-System/wiki/Design-Tokens)

## Components?
Components are reusable pieces of code within your system and they serve as building blocks of an interface. Thus, a component has characteristics such as: reusability, flexibility, consistency, and modularity.

The list of components can be found in the [documentation](https://github.com/paixaoDev/MOBILE-Design-System/wiki/Components), there we have the components already created and those we intend to create in the future.

## Disclamer
This repository was created as a chance to learn more about compose and design system development, constructive feedback is very important so we can learn together!

It is also important to understand how Compose works and not ignore its greatest quality, which is easy customization. Therefore, the components here will be "more open" than what we can find in other design systems, making it easier to implement in the project and edit during use. Even though this may deviate a little from the rule of most design systems, it does not make sense to restrict the components. Therefore, any way to improve the dynamics of the items considering these premises is very welcome.

I hope this repository is another reason to encourage the studies that it is used in your projects, let's create more content for compose and android development!
